# ProjectPythonVR
## Description
  Project Python VR is an interactible video game made in Unity, where the player will be able to repair spaceships by solving coding problems. The main feature of Project Python VR is that the players are given empty boxes that are "variables" and data objects that are "ints, floats, Strings, and booleans". The player must pick up the data object and either manipulate it by adding or multiplying other data objects, or place it within the variable box. Once the correct variable is within the box, a spaceship will be repaired and the player will move on to the next level. The main technology is Virtual Reality, done through the Oculus Quest VR Headset. The target for this project is to teach people unfamiliar with coding and VR the basics of variables and variable manipulation, the basics of loops, and how to use and interact with virtual reality.
  TAP, the Technology Ambassadors Program, aims to increase the number of students who persist in an IT major or minor, particularly those underrepresented in computing by using interesting and new technologies.

## Technology
  The technology we are using is Virtual Reality. Virtual Reality is a computer generated 3D environment that people can interact with in real life space using special equipment, usually a headset and two controllers, one for each hand. Unity is a game development engine that anyone can use for free, and creators can develop for many platforms uncluding VR.
